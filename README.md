The stuff we are going to used today to build an alcohol indicator is Arduino, LEDs, and an MQ-3 Alcohol sensor. There are many MQ-X sensors is available in the market for different uses but we are here going to use MQ-3 because it is best for detecting alcohol. The working of most of the MQ sensors is the same. They all contain a heating element that heats up a layer of conducting material whose resistance is continuously measured. Its resistance changes when fumes or smell from alcohol comes in contact with the MQ-3 sensor. Arduino based alcohol detector having the mq3 sensor the specification given above. which can be monitor in our IoT based alcohol detector project.

Any microcontroller preferably Arduino Uno for beginners.
